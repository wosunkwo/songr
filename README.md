This repository cotains a spring application that runs on port 8080 and handles three paths:
/hello
/capitalize/
/reverse

The first path prints "Hello World" on the users screen
The second path capitalizes any world that is passed after the last forward slash(/)
The third path reverses any sentence passed to it.

HOW TO RUN
1) Fork this repo
2) Make a clone to your local computer
3) Run "gradle bootRun" on your terminal 
4) Go to each of the three paths on your browser
